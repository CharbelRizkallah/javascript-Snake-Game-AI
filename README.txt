This AI uses the path finding algorithm A* to find the fastest path to the apple without going through it's tail.
The snake will stop moving when it can't find an immediate path to the snake.
It never touches it's tail, it only stops because it's tail surrounded it.

- By clicking anywhere on the black canvas, the clicked square will become a wall that the snake will avoid when going to the apple.
- By clicking the white square (yellow when ON) the snake will pause and stop moving, allowing you time to put walls.
- By clicking the blue square, all walls will be cleared.

The snake will restart when you refresh the page.
